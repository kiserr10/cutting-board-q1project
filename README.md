# Cutting Board App - Q1

## Project Description
I am going to create a single page web application where any user can come to my site and enter/submit either a name of a meal, or a list of desired core ingredients; the app will present the top 10 rated recipes of that specific meal, or meals that contain the desired ingredients.  The recipes will be presented nicely on the page with thumbnail images and a title, and the user will be able to click the image, and then see the recipe, ingredients, and cooking procedure.  Simply put I am going to design a recipe/meal generator that will help users with their creative cooking needs.  If you never cook, or perhaps you do, but don't own a cookbook, this app will help you in your decision making process and will teach you basic cooking as well!

* STRETCH: Not only will I list the ingredients needed to cook the meal but I will also include a list of kitchen tools that would be necessary to complete the cooking process
* STRETCH: I am going to include a favorite recipes section where a user could store their favorites while browsing recipes/meals
* STRETCH: I am going to create a meals of the week calendar where users can drag the recipe cards onto a weekly calendar with three slots per day.  The user can then drag a recipe on to a certain meal slot for a specific day
